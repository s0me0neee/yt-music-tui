# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
cargo build          # compile
cargo run            # run the TUI
cargo check          # fast type-check without linking
cargo test           # run tests (offline — network tests are #[ignore]d)
cargo test <name>    # run a single test by name

cargo test -p lrclib -- --ignored   # the live lrclib.net API tests
```

### Linking libmpv

libmpv is linked, not spawned, so the build needs the *library* — the mpv player on its own
is not enough. `ytm-core/build.rs` finds it in one of two ways:

- **`LIBMPV_DIR`**, if set: the directory holding the import library. Checked first, and on
  Windows it is the only option — there is no pkg-config, and the mpv player builds ship no
  import library at all. Unpack the **mpv-dev** package (`libmpv-2.dll`, `libmpv.dll.a`,
  `include/mpv/`) from [shinchiro/mpv-winbuild-cmake][mpv-win] and point `LIBMPV_DIR` at it;
  the same directory has to be on `PATH` at runtime so `libmpv-2.dll` can be loaded.
  A missing DLL shows up as a bare `STATUS_DLL_NOT_FOUND` exit, with no message.
- **pkg-config** otherwise, which is what picks up Homebrew's libmpv on macOS
  (`brew install mpv`) and the distro package on Linux (`libmpv-dev`).

## Credential Setup

Auth uses cookie-based auth via `browser.json` (ytmusicapi style — no OAuth).

On first run (`browser.json` absent), the app runs an interactive setup that shells out to
`yt-dlp --cookies-from-browser` to extract YouTube cookies from a local browser profile.
The browser that worked is written to `config.toml` as `auth.cookie-browser`, so a later
expiry renews itself by re-running yt-dlp rather than prompting — set `auth.auto-reauth =
false` to always be asked. `Session::reauth` reports which happened via `Reauth`, and an
automatic renewal lets `main.rs` carry on instead of asking for a restart.
Config lives in `~/.config/yt-music-tui/` (`browser.json`, `queue.json`, `settings.json`,
`lyrics.json`, `config.toml`, `app.log`). Everything but `config.toml` is written by the
app; `config.toml` is the hand-edited one, read once at startup by `config.rs`.

## Architecture

A Cargo workspace with three members. `ytm-core` is UI-agnostic so the engine can be driven
by something other than the ratatui frontend.

```
lrclib/     lyrics.net API client + LRC format parser (no app knowledge)
ytm-core/   session/auth, library, playback, queue, lyrics policy, persistence
tui/        the ratatui frontend — single `ytm` binary
```

### `lrclib/`

- **`api.rs`** — `LrcLib` client over `reqwest` (async). `get`, `get_by_id`, `search`,
  `search_by_meta`. Timeouts are set on the client so a hung server can't stall the UI.
- **`lrc.rs`** — `parse_lrc` turns raw `[mm:ss.xx]line` text into sorted `LyricLine`s;
  `active_index` answers "which line is playing at time *t*" via binary search;
  `next_boundary` drives the redraw schedule. Handles multi-timestamp lines, metadata tags,
  and `[offset:]`.

### `ytm-core/`

- **`session.rs`** — `Session`: cookie extraction via yt-dlp, `browser.json` I/O, config paths.
- **`library.rs`** — `Library`, `Track`, `Playlist`. `spawn_library_fetch` streams each
  playlist's tracks back over an `mpsc` channel as they arrive.
- **`playback.rs`** — `AudioEngine` owns an in-process **libmpv** instance (`libmpv2`) on its
  own thread, plus an `Arc<Mutex<AudioState>>` snapshot. `AudioState::elapsed` is the live
  playback position, fed by an mpv `time-pos` property observer.
- **`player.rs`** — `Player`: queue, play modes, volume/mute, song-end advance.
- **`lyrics.rs`** — policy over `lrclib`. `LyricsService::best_for` layers `/get` (exact, has
  duration, returns one) over `/search` (returns many, ignores duration), preferring synced
  over plain; `rank` does duration-proximity scoring client-side. `spawn_best`/`spawn_choices`
  do the fetching in background tokio tasks.
- **`persistence.rs`** — `queue.json`, `settings.json` (volume), `lyrics.json` (manual lyric
  choices, keyed by video ID).
- **`config.rs`** — `config.toml`, the hand-edited settings, read once at startup. Every
  value has a working default and a missing or malformed file falls back to those with a
  log warning, so a typo can never stop playback. `lyrics.offset` shifts every lyric line
  against the record's timings (negative = early, positive = late); it is applied by
  shifting the clock handed to `active_index`/`next_boundary`, never the cached records.
  `auth.auto-reauth` / `auth.cookie-browser` drive silent re-authentication.
  `remember_cookie_browser` writes back through `toml_edit`, so the user's comments and
  formatting survive — this is the one file the app both reads and writes.

### `tui/`

- **`main.rs`** — logging, ctrlc handler, session setup, builds the tokio runtime, kicks off
  the background library fetch, then hands off to `App::run()`.
- **`app.rs`** — all TUI state and rendering.
  - **Chrome**: no bordered panels. Each panel is a `section()` — an uppercase
    header, an optional right-aligned status, and a rule — separated by
    whitespace. Only *overlays* (the `?` keymap, the lyrics picker) keep a
    border, because they float above other content.
  - **Colour**: every style is a named constant in the `theme` module, and every
    value is an **ANSI named colour** (never `Rgb`/`Indexed`) so the user's own
    terminal palette drives the look. One role per colour — Cyan is focus and
    keys, Green is playing, Yellow warns, Red errors, Gray/DarkGray are content
    metadata and chrome respectively.
  - **Focus** is carried by the section header's colour and by the selection
    style (`SELECTED` vs `SELECTED_BLUR`), since there is no border to tint.
  - **Filter**: `/` opens inline filter mode; `Enter` confirms (keeps filter), `Esc` clears.
  - **Queue**: `a` appends, `d` removes, `o` toggles queue/songs view, `p`/`n` skip.
  - **Prefetch**: j/k in Songs warms the CDN URL for the selected + next song.
  - **Lyrics**: `y` replaces the right column with a synced-lyrics panel that auto-centres the
    active line; `c` opens a modal to pick a different lrclib record; `r` retries a failed
    fetch. Results are cached per video ID and never re-fetched, so toggling is free.
    The picker collapses records carrying identical lyrics — two thirds of what lrclib
    returns for a popular track — and its left column marks `IN USE` (what the panel is
    showing) and `AUTO` (the record automatic matching resolved to). The record on screen
    is guaranteed a row, since it is often the `/get` hit the search ladder never sees.

### Event loop cadence

`event::poll` normally blocks 200 ms, but `App::poll_timeout` shortens it to wake just after
the next lyric boundary while synced lyrics are following playback (clamped to 33–200 ms).
Lyrics mode off ⇒ unchanged 200 ms, so there is no idle cost.

### Keybindings

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `k` | Navigate down / up (scroll lyrics in lyrics mode) |
| `h` / `l` | Switch panels (Playlists ↔ Songs) |
| `Enter` | Open playlist / play song / play from queue |
| `/` | Enter filter mode (songs or queue panel) |
| `Esc` | Re-centre lyrics → close lyrics → clear filter → back to playlists → quit |
| `Space` | Pause / resume |
| `p` / `n` | Previous / next in queue |
| `←` / `→` | Seek −5s / +5s |
| `↑` / `↓` | Volume +5 / −5 |
| `m` | Mute / unmute |
| `t` | Cycle play mode (Cycle → Single → Shuffle) |
| `a` | Append selected song to queue |
| `d` | Remove selected queue entry |
| `o` | Toggle queue / songs view |
| `y` | Toggle lyrics panel |
| `c` | (in lyrics mode) Choose a different lrclib record |
| `r` | (in lyrics mode) Retry a failed lyrics fetch |
| `?` | Full keymap overlay (any key closes it) |
| `q` / `Ctrl+C` | Quit |

The one-row help bar shows only as many hints as fit, dropping whole hints from
the end (`fit_hints`) — the full list needs ~143 columns, so `?` is where the
complete keymap lives.

Note: raw mode clears `ISIG`, so `Ctrl+C` never becomes a signal — `app.rs` matches it as a
key event. The `ctrlc` handler in `main.rs` only covers SIGTERM/SIGHUP.

### Data flow

```
main.rs
  └─ Session::build_client()
  └─ library::get_playlists()  ──► App::new(library, saved_queue, songs_rx, rt_handle)
  └─ library::spawn_library_fetch()   └─ App::run()
       (tokio tasks → mpsc)                └─ event_loop
                                                ├─ drain_song_channel / drain_lyrics
                                                ├─ render
                                                └─ Player → AudioEngine → libmpv
```

## Dependency notes

Cargo resolves versions more loosely than expected in edition 2024. When adding or updating
dependencies, pin exact versions in `Cargo.toml` and run `cargo tree` to confirm the resolved
version before writing code against a specific API.

**reqwest is pinned to 0.12** across the workspace to match what `ytmusicapi` already pulls in.
Do not bump `lrclib` to 0.13 casually — it would add a second HTTP stack plus an `aws-lc-sys`
C build (needs cc + cmake). Verify with `cargo tree -i aws-lc-sys` (should report *not found*).
Note 0.12 has no `query` feature; `.query()` is unconditional there.

Key deps: `ratatui 0.30`, `ytmusicapi 0.4.2`, `libmpv2 6`, `reqwest 0.12`, `thiserror 1`,
`ctrlc 3` (termination feature), `simplelog 0.12`, `rand 0.8`, `throbber-widgets-tui 0.11`.
